Surprise; Where hosting an event here in Wellington on the 23rd of May!!!

If you haven't heard already, NodeBots is a fun event where you get to build robots with JavaScript!

That's right... if you've any JavaScript experience, you can now use your powers to manipulate the machines. From [blinking lights](http://instagram.com/p/cFVNtmJxlc/) to [Sumo Bot battles](http://nodebots.io/sumo.html), [Remote control cats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NYyGC-wZKU), and [Bull fighting with quadcopters](https://github.com/substack/matador-copter)...


If you have no idea how to use an LED, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be on hand to help you hack, wire, and solder your way to a full fledged NodeBot. It's aimed for ages 14 and up, but if you're a smart cookie and not quite 14 yet we'll still let you code some robots :D

We have a range of things to build and learn about at our NodeBots events, from messing with [sound](https://twitter.com/PrototypeAlex/status/582070216001077249) and [light](https://twitter.com/PrototypeAlex/status/580538795520614401), all the way though to building robotic arms to help pickup coffee cups.

The only thing you'll need to bring is yourself and a laptop, and maybe some lunch for the day, we'll supply everything else.

Ticket prices are $15 each, but if you’re a bit cash strapped then use the discount code NODEBOTS_IS_AWESOME, and the ticket will be free. We have low overheads, so as long as there’s a few people paying for tickets, the minimum gets paid, anything left over goes into buying more awesome gear.

Checkout [ti.to/nodebots-new-zealand/nodebots-wellington-may](https://ti.to/nodebots-new-zealand/nodebots-wellington-may) for tickets, and hopefully we'll see you there.
