We’re back, with another event in Wellington, on July the 26th come join other keen minded robot masters and explore the wonderful world of robotics and electronics. This event is run simultaneously around the world as International NodeBots day, we’ll be connecting with other NodeBots events in a heap of different countries to learn and hack together.

NodeBots day isn’t your typical hackathon, this event is about learning and having fun with electronics using JavaScript. You’ll get to play with LEDs, servos, sensors, Ardiunos and maybe even a Rasberry Pi.

#### Who should attend?
Anyone who has an interest in how things work, be it electronics or programming, anyone with a curious mind will enjoy NodeBots.

#### What do I need to bring?
Yourself, a laptop if you have one, and some lunch or lunch money.

You don’t need to bring any hardware, we’ll supply everything you need to build a fully functioning robot. If you have any hardware of your own, do bring it along to show off, we’re trying to grow a community and sharing knowledge is an easy win.

#### What will we do?
Anything and everything, the kits are built to teach everything from how an LED works to making a flappycat game on an LCD screen. We’ll be building Sumobots at some stage during the day, and having a Sumobot battle, but to quote John Key, at the end of the day, you’re free to build anything you want.

### Can I bring my child?
Yes, we encourage young minds to come and learn with us, and we’ve frequently had kids from 7-12 join us, but do keep in mind that the day isn’t setup for kids, and guided learning might be needed, so an guardian will be required to help out.

#### What does it cost?
$15.00, thought we do have a discount that will make the ticket free, this is so everyone can attend. We need to cover costs for expendables, but thank’s to our awesome sponsors the kit has been covered, so we can keep the entry fee low.

So join us on Sunday the 26th for a day of hacking and learning.
