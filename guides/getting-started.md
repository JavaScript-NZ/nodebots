# Getting started

> This section is dedicated to help you get started with the hardware and software, if you're after the event details and schedule it can be found here: [nodebots day schedule]().

Were you begin your nodebots journey depends on what background you have with electronics and javascript.

The best approach is to team up with people that complement your skill set, this is probably the easiest way to learn and by far the most fun.

If you do want to go solo on this, then what you need to get started roughly depends on which category you fall under:
```
hacker - understand electronics and understand programming

coder  - new to electronics but understand programming

sparky - understand electronics but new to programming

newbie - new to electronics and new to programming
```

Just remember, there will be helpers floating around the event, they're there to help you so don't be shy.

## Hackers
If you're strong in both, then I suggest jumping straight into [johnny-five.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) and checkout their api, it's very easy to use and once you've setup your Arduino you'll be spinning servos in no time.

Make your way over to the [nodebots day schedule]() when you're ready.

## Coders
If you know how to code, but are still learning the ropes of electronics, then the best place to get started is the [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) nodebots module:

```
npm install -g nodebot-workshop
nodebot-workshop
```

Pay close attention to each adventure, as they will link to resources that explain the electronic components you'll be interacting with.

Make your way over to the [nodebots day schedule]() when you're ready.

## Sparkies
If you're a sparky then you should start off doing a few basic [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) adventures, these will teach you some fundamentals, and get you comfortable using JavaScript to hack up your Arduino.

I'd recommend the following nodeschool adventures:

- javascripting
- learnyounode
- nodebot-workshop

After that, you should be good to go. Make your way over to the [nodebots day schedule]() when you're ready.

## Newbies
If you're new to both hardware and software, then the best path would be to do the following  [nodeschools](http://nodeschool.io/), paying close attention to the resources linked in the nodebot-workshop adventure (they will teach you about the hardware).

- javascripting
- learnyounode
- nodebot-workshop

Be sure to yell out when you're stuck, there will be some hackers out there that are more than happy to help.
