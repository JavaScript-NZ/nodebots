# nz.js(con).nodebots

Haere mai, and welcome to the nz.js(con).nodebots workshop.

Thanks to our awesome sponsors at Xero, who you should checkout if you're looking for JavaScript jobs, we have 12 Parrot mini-drones to hack on.

So today we'll be working with drones ðŸ¤–!

For the first part of the workshop, you'll be connecting to the drones, using node and JavaScript.

Once you're up and running it's up to you how you control them. Through controllers, phones, pebble watches, leap motions... the sky is the limit.

Thirty minutes before the end of the event, we'll be hosting a drone racing knockout elimination tournament, where you'll be racing your drone around a course, in groups of 4 to find the ultimate node drone racing champion.

There will be prizes for the winners, with spot prizes in the mix, and no doubt drone crashes worthy of tweeting about.

If you're not in to drones, or we've run out of drones to offer, we'll also be running our classic sumo-bot tournament, where you can build a two wheeled sumo-bot, and battle it in a sumo-fighting tournament.

## Gear up

There are only 12 drones, so we'll be working in groups to get the job done, so form a group or grab a buddy, then be sure to pick up your drone from the nodebots depot, likely located on the table where everyone is scrambling too.

Once you have your drone, and a few backup batteries, you'll want to make sure you have a lego mini-figure your team relates to, then you're ready to start hacking.

Alternatively, if we're out of drones, then pickup a sparkfun inventors kit and a sumo-bot chassis and head on over to: [link here] for details on how to build it.
